The task is to create a dashboard that lists items with specific properties and visual representations: 
Dashboard Items: Each item in the dashboard will have the following properties:

IMAGE (string): This represents the thumbnail image of a sound item.

TITLE (string): The title of the sound item.

TOTAL PLAYS (number): The total number of times the sound item has been played.

COMPLETETION RATE (number): The rate at which the entire sound item has been listened to by users.

Graph for Unique Plays and Total Plays: You need to display the unique_plays and total_plays as a graph. This graph will visualize the number of unique plays and total plays for each sound item. You can use a charting library like Chart.js or Recharts to create the graph.

Progress Bar for Completion Rate: You need to display the completion_rate as a progress bar. The progress bar should have a maximum value of 100, representing 100% completion of the sound item. The progress bar will visually indicate how much of the sound item has been listened to by the user.
